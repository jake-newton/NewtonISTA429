Data Management - I think subpart F is very important since not all data can fit on one table, multiple
tables might be needed in order to properly sort or order the information and having unique identifiers
prevents spill-over onto other tables or programs reading the same data twice, overwriting data, and
perhaps even causing the program to crash.

Software - Making Dependencies and requirements explicit allows developers or people using your code to
know troubleshoot effectively and ensure high-quality analysis over all of their data.

Collaboration - Creating a shared "to-do list" allows a team or group to effectively collaborate on a
project by breaking down the project into sections that individuals can tackle and it creates a roadmap
to project completion.

Project Organization - Naming all files to reflect their contents allows the team to quickly direct their
efforts into the right files instead of searching through every file in a directory to find what they are
looking for.

Keeping track of changes - Sharing changes frequently ensures that team members do not work on old material,
keeping the team informed of alterations within a timely manner.

Licensing - I chose the GNU Public License 3.0 since it allows others to use my work while ensuring I am not 
held liable for the implementation of my ideas, seeing as it is the newest version, it accounts for more 
current development.

README - Contains Repository Name and description as well as a description on the intended use of the files.
